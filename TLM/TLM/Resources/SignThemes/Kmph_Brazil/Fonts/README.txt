Highway Gothic (formally known as the FHWA Series fonts or the Standard 
Alphabets for Highway Signs) is a sans-serif typeface developed by the United 
States Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and used for road signage in the 
Americas, including the U.S., Canada, and Latin American countries, as well as 
in Asian countries influenced by American signage practices, including the 
Philippines, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Variants, minor 
and major (but not the exact US typeface) are used in countries like Turkey, 
Mexico, Australia (AS1744 fonts), Spain, the Netherlands, Brazil, New Zealand, 
Macau (written in Portuguese), and some signs in countries like India and Saudi 
Arabia, when written in English. The typefaces were developed to maximize 
legibility at a distance and at high speed. Computer typeface versions known as 
Highway Gothic or Interstate (a separate typeface), which are for sale to the 
general public, include punctuation marks based on a rectangular shape. 
However, on signage the official FHWA Series punctuation is based on a circular 
shape.
